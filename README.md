## 🗺 **Latest AI Research Results** (October 2, 2025)

### **Real AI Q&A Session Output - LIVE RESULTS** 🎯

**Market Conditions Analyzed**: Extreme volatility (CoV=108%) with price swings from -$935 to +$254/MWh

**AI Generated Questions & Answers:**

🧠 **Q: "What caused the high volatility today?"**  
💬 **A**: "High volatility (CoV=108.0%, σ=$25.5) likely caused by: rapid supply-demand imbalances (both scarcity and oversupply), extreme price swings ($1190/MWh range)."  
🎯 **Confidence: 75%**

🧠 **Q: "Did our battery capitalize on this opportunity?"**  
💬 **A**: "No. Battery never discharged despite 2,499 high-price intervals. Estimated missed revenue: $1,023,801."  
🎯 **Confidence: 85%**

🧠 **Q: "How does this compare to our theoretical maximum?"**  
💬 **A**: "Theoretical maximum profit: $16,961.71 (assuming perfect foresight). Actual performance: -$4,233.12 (-25% of theoretical max). Negative returns indicate poor timing or adverse market conditions."  
🎯 **Confidence: 80%**

**Performance**: 9 questions answered automatically, 5 with high confidence (≥70%), average 60% confidence
