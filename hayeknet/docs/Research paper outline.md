# **Paper Outline: Simulating Battery Bidding Strategies in ERCOT Under RTC+B**

---

### **1. Introduction**

* Motivation: ERCOT’s unique market, upcoming RTC+B redesign.
* Problem statement: How will battery bidding strategies shift under RTC+B?
* Contribution: A comparative simulation study using real ERCOT data and prototype co-optimization.
* Paper structure preview.

---

### **2. Literature Review** *(outline we built earlier)*

* ERCOT market design & evolution.
* Energy storage participation in power markets.
* Modeling approaches: optimization, Bayesian forecasting, RL.
* Anticipated impacts of RTC+B.
* Gaps and research opportunity.

---

### **3. Market Background** *(make it accessible for non-specialists)*

* Quick overview of DAM and RTM.
* How batteries participate today (energy arbitrage + AS).
* What changes under RTC+B: co-optimization, ASDCs, single-model ESR.

---

### **4. Data and Methods**

**4.1 Data Sources**


* ERCOT MIS reports (for validation).

**4.2 Battery Model**

* Define size (100 MW / 400 MWh), efficiency, SOC constraints.
* Equations for SOC updates.

**4.3 Trading Strategies**

* Baseline arbitrage (charge low, discharge high).
* Arbitrage + ancillary service offers (using MCPCs).
* RTC+B approximation (co-optimized objective with ASDCs).

**4.4 Forecasting Approaches**

* Bayesian short-term price forecasting.
* RL framework for sequential decision-making.

**4.5 Evaluation Metrics**

* PnL, Sharpe ratio, SOC utilization, frequency of AS vs energy dispatch.

---

### **5. Results**

**5.1 Baseline Arbitrage Results**

* SOC trajectories, PnL under current rules.

**5.2 Adding Ancillary Services**

* Incremental value from RegUp, Non-Spin, etc.

**5.3 RTC+B Approximation**

* Comparison of co-optimized vs current.
* Charts: LMPs with ASDCs factored in, PnL deltas.

**5.4 Forecasting & RL Performance**

* Bayesian vs naïve forecast accuracy.
* RL agent vs rule-based strategy.

---

### **6. Discussion**

* What results imply for ERCOT traders post-RTC+B.
* Risk factors (forecast errors, SOC mismanagement).
* How results align with ERCOT’s simulation studies.
* Academic contribution: showing methods + results gap.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

* Summary of findings.
* Implications for ERCOT market participants.
* Limitations: simplified model, proxy RTC+B rules.
* Future work: incorporate actual RTC+B settlement data after Dec. 5, 2025.

---

### **8. References**

* ERCOT Protocols & Training docs.
* IMM & ERCOT reports on RTC.
* Prior academic studies on storage, forecasting, and RL in power markets.

---

### **Appendix (optional)**

* Equations for battery dispatch optimization.
* Extra charts (heatmaps, congestion spreads).
