## ⚠️ Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. **Missing Data: Ancillary Service Prices**

**Problem**: Your research needs MCPC (ancillary service clearing prices) data.

**What you have**: Only LMP (energy prices)

**What you need**:
- Regulation Up/Down prices
- Responsive Reserve prices  
- Non-Spin prices
- ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS) prices

**Solution**: Enhance data client to fetch AS reports

### 2. **Missing Data: ASDC Curves**

**Problem**: RTC+B analysis requires Ancillary Service Demand Curves.

**Current status**: Not collected

**Solution**: Add ASDC report types to data ingestion

### 3. **Observations Not Structured**

**Problem**: Daily journal has generic observation templates.

**Your research needs**: Specific battery-focused observations:
- SOC patterns
- Price volatility impact on bidding
- Energy vs AS dispatch frequency
- Forecast accuracy metrics

**Solution**: Enhance daily workflow with battery-specific metrics
