## **Literature Review Outline**

**1. ERCOT Market Design & Evolution**

* Overview of DAM/RTM structure.
* Policy and protocol changes leading to RTC+B.

**2. Role of Energy Storage in Power Markets**

* Economic value streams for batteries: arbitrage, ancillary services, capacity.
* Prior ERCOT storage pilots (FRRS, Non-Spin, Regulation).

**3. Modeling Approaches in Academic and Industry Studies**

* Optimization methods for storage bidding (linear programming, stochastic programming).
* Forecasting approaches (Bayesian inference for load/renewables, machine learning for price).
* Reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making in energy trading.

**4. Anticipated Impacts of RTC+B**

* ERCOTâ€™s studies of co-optimization cost savings.
* Industry commentary on ASDCs and single-model ESR.

**5. Gaps & Opportunity**

* Lack of pre/post RTC+B comparative studies on battery strategies.
* Limited application of advanced ML methods (Bayesian + RL) in ERCOT context.

## **Concrete Executable Analysis Plan**

**Overall Goal by End of Semester:**
Produce a **simulation-based comparative analysis** of a utility-scale battery in ERCOT, showing how profits and bidding strategies differ under:

1. Current market rules.
2. A simplified RTC+B approximation.

Deliver a paper with quantitative results (PnL comparisons, strategy performance metrics, SOC charts).
