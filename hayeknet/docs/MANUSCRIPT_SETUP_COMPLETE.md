## 🚀 Quick Start

### Generate the Paper

From project root:
```bash
make paper
```

This creates:
- `docs/manuscript.html` (interactive, 1.3 MB) ✅ Already generated!
- `docs/manuscript.pdf` (publication-ready)

### View Your Paper

```bash
open docs/manuscript.html   # Open in browser
```

Or directly:
```bash
cd docs
quarto preview manuscript.qmd   # Live-reload preview
```

## 📊 What's Already in the Paper

### Key Findings Written Up

1. **Economic Viability Analysis**
   - Energy arbitrage alone: -$11,583/day (with degradation)
   - RTC+B projection: +$2,600 to +$21,100/day
   - Conclusion: AS participation essential

2. **Volatility Relationship**
   - Optimal: 40-50% CoV (not maximum!)
   - Evidence from 5 days of data
   - Non-linear relationship identified

3. **SOC Management**
   - Strong correlation (r ≈ 0.85) with profitability
   - Target: 65-75% utilization
   - Critical success factor

4. **Strategy Inefficiency**
   - Capture efficiency: 3-22% of theoretical maximum
   - Major gaps: timing, positioning, idle time
   - Forecast-based improvement potential

### Data Already Documented

- **Period**: October 1-5, 2025
- **Observations**: 263,250 total
- **Settlement points**: 1,053
- **Intervals**: 288 per day (5-minute)

### Tables & Metrics

- Week 1 summary statistics
- Daily performance breakdown (Oct 2-5)
- Capture efficiency comparison
- Economic viability with degradation costs
- RTC+B revenue projections

## 📝 Next Steps for Writing

### Priority 1: Generate Figures (This Week)

Create these key plots from your existing data:

```bash
# In your Python analysis scripts, generate:
1. Volatility vs PnL scatter (colored by SOC utilization)
2. SOC utilization vs PnL (sized by cycles/day)
3. Daily LMP distributions (5-day panel)
4. Battery SOC trajectories (5-day time series)
```

Save as:
- `docs/figures/volatility_pnl.png`
- `docs/figures/soc_utilization_pnl.png`
- `docs/figures/lmp_distributions.png`
- `docs/figures/soc_trajectories.png`

Then reference in manuscript:
```markdown
![Volatility vs Profitability](figures/volatility_pnl.png){#fig-volatility-pnl}
```

### Priority 2: Expand Literature Review (Next Week)

Add 10-15 more references covering:
- ERCOT nodal market evolution
- Battery participation in other ISOs (CAISO, PJM)
- MIP formulations for battery scheduling
- Price forecasting methods (ARIMA, LSTM)
- RL applications to energy storage

### Priority 3: Week 2 Data Collection (Ongoing)

Continue daily data collection to:
- Validate Week 1 patterns
- Test hypotheses on new data
- Expand sample size for statistical significance

## 🎯 Writing Strategy

### "Living Document" Approach

The manuscript is designed to grow incrementally:

1. **Week 1 (Now)**: Skeleton + Week 1 results ✅
2. **Week 2**: Add figures, expand lit review
3. **Week 3**: Add forecasting section
4. **Week 4**: Add RL results, complete TODOs
5. **Month End**: Polish, final draft

### TODO Markers

Search for `[TODO: ...]` in manuscript:
```bash
grep -n "TODO" docs/manuscript.qmd
```

Currently 28 TODOs across:
- Literature review expansion
- Missing figures
- Forecasting results
- RL performance
- Appendices

### Incremental Updates

After each daily run:
1. Update summary statistics
2. Add new observations
3. Refine hypotheses
4. Re-render: `make paper`
