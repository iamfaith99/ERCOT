- [ ] Were there missed opportunities?
- [ ] How did forecast accuracy affect bidding?

### RTC+B Comparison
- [ ] How might co-optimization change strategy?
- [ ] Would AS participation be more profitable?
- [ ] Impact of ASDCs on revenue?

### Research Questions
- [ ] What price volatility makes arbitrage profitable?
- [ ] Optimal SOC management?
- [ ] Impact of cycling on degradation?

## üî¨ Current Battery Configuration

```python
BatterySpecs:
    max_charge_mw: 100.0 MW
    max_discharge_mw: 100.0 MW
    capacity_mwh: 400.0 MWh
    min_soc: 0.1 (10%)
    max_soc: 0.9 (90%)
    initial_soc: 0.5 (50%)
    
    charge_efficiency: 0.95 (95%)

## ‚úÖ Example Output (Today)

From today's run (Sept 29, 2025):

**Market**:
- 6,282 observations (6 x 5-min intervals)
- Mean LMP: $74.24/MWh
- Volatility: $7.13/MWh (low)

**Battery Performance**:
- Only charged (no discharge opportunities)
- Lost $3,949.56 (paid for charging)
- 12.4% SOC utilization
- 0.12 cycles

**Insight**: Low volatility day with limited arbitrage opportunities. Strategy needs optimization for low-spread conditions.

## üìä Metrics Reference

### SOC Metrics
- `soc_mean`: Average state of charge
- `soc_utilization_pct`: % of usable capacity used
- `soc_range`: Total SOC swing

### Operational Metrics
- `charge_intervals`: # of charging intervals
- `discharge_intervals`: # of discharging intervals
- `estimated_cycles`: Full-cycle equivalents
- `active_pct`: % of time active (not idle)

### Financial Metrics
- `final_pnl`: Net profit/loss for the day
- `discharge_revenue`: $ earned from discharging
- `charge_cost`: $ spent charging
- `gross_profit_margin`: Profitability %

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Battery Analysis Fails
The workflow will continue and show:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Battery analysis unavailable for this run
```

**Check**:
1. Data availability: `df` should not be empty
2. LMP columns: Need `timestamp`, `lmp_usd`, `settlement_point`
3. Error messages in console

### If Metrics Look Wrong
- Very low utilization (<5%): Strategy may be too conservative
- Negative PnL: Charging more than discharging (or low spreads)
- Zero cycles: No discharge opportunities found
