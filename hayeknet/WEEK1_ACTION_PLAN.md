- What report IDs for ASDCs?

**Document** findings for future implementation

---

### **Day 6-7 (Weekend)** - Run First Experiments
**Time**: 2 hours

```bash
# Run battery workflow all week days
# Review accumulated data
# Document initial patterns
# Plan Week 2 experiments
```

---

## 🛠️ Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Battery Workflow Script (Priority 1)

**File**: `scripts/daily_battery_workflow.py`

**Pseudocode**:
```python
def main():
    # 1. Load latest LMP data
    df = load_latest_lmp_data()
    
    # 2. Run battery arbitrage
    battery = BatteryModel(capacity_mw=100, energy_mwh=400)
    results_arbitrage = run_arbitrage_strategy(battery, df)
    
    # 3. Calculate metrics
    pnl = calculate_pnl(results_arbitrage)
    soc_stats = analyze_soc_patterns(results_arbitrage)
    
    # 4. Generate journal
    journal = create_battery_journal(
        date=today,
        pnl=pnl,
        soc_stats=soc_stats,
        market_data=df
    )
    
    # 5. Save results
    save_battery_journal(journal)
    save_battery_results(results_arbitrage)
```

---

### Task 2: Battery Journal Template

**File**: `research/battery_journal/journal_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Battery Research Journal - {date}
## Day {N} of Research Period

### Market Summary
- LMP mean/std
- Price volatility
- High price events

### Battery Performance
- SOC utilization: X%
- Charging cycles: N
- Discharging cycles: M

## 📚 What to Read This Week

1. **Your battery code**:
   - `python/battery_model.py` - Understand the model
   - `python/battery_strategy.py` - Understand strategies
   - `examples/battery_sced_vs_rtcb.py` - See it in action

2. **Research papers**:
   - Pick 2-3 battery storage papers for lit review
   - ERCOT RTC documentation
   - Take notes for your paper

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Keep It Simple
- Start with basic arbitrage only
- Add complexity in Week 2+
- Document everything as you go

### 2. Use Templates
- Copy `daily_research_workflow.py` structure
- Modify for battery-specific needs
- Don't reinvent the wheel

### 3. Focus on Observations
- The data matters most
- Write down what you notice
- Your observations become your paper

### 4. Ask for Help
- If you get stuck, we can assist
- Battery examples already exist
- Lots of working code to learn from

## ⚠️ What NOT to Do

1. ❌ Don't try to add AS data yet (complex)
2. ❌ Don't try to implement full RTC+B yet (Week 6-7)
3. ❌ Don't worry about perfect code (iterate)
4. ❌ Don't skip daily runs (data consistency matters)

---

## 🎯 Week 1 Deliverable

**By Oct 5, you'll have**:
- Working battery daily workflow
- 7 days of battery observations
- Baseline understanding of system
- Ready for Week 2 deeper analysis

---

## Next Steps After Week 1

**Week 2-3**: Run more experiments, vary parameters  
**Week 4-5**: Add complexity (AS strategies)  
**Week 6-7**: RTC+B approximation  
**Week 8-9**: RL training & case studies  
**Week 10**: Paper writing
