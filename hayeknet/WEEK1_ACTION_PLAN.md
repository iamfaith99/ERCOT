# Week 1 Action Plan: Battery Research Setup
**Target**: Get battery-specific research workflow operational  
**Timeline**: Sept 29 - Oct 5, 2025 (7 days)  
**Estimated Time**: 10-12 hours total

---

## ✅ Assessment Summary

**Your Research**: Battery bidding strategies (current vs RTC+B)  
**HayekNet Status**: 85% ready  
**Critical Gap**: Need battery-specific observations in daily workflow

---

## 🎯 Week 1 Goals

By end of Week 1, you should have:
1. ✅ Battery simulations running daily
2. ✅ Battery-specific research journal
3. ✅ Ancillary service data collection (if possible)
4. ✅ Baseline experimental results

---

## 📋 Day-by-Day Plan

### **Day 1 (Monday, Sept 30)** - Validate Current System
**Time**: 2 hours

```bash
# Morning routine
make daily

# Afternoon: Test battery examples
source activate_hayeknet.sh
python examples/battery_sced_vs_rtcb.py

# Document what works
```

**Deliverable**: Understand current battery capabilities

---

### **Day 2 (Tuesday, Oct 1)** - Create Battery Daily Workflow
**Time**: 3 hours

**Create**: `scripts/daily_battery_workflow.py`

**Should do**:
1. Run battery arbitrage simulation
2. Calculate daily PnL
3. Track SOC patterns
4. Generate battery journal entry

**Based on**: Existing `daily_research_workflow.py` structure

---

### **Day 3 (Wednesday, Oct 2)** - Test & Refine
**Time**: 2 hours

```bash
# Test new workflow
python scripts/daily_battery_workflow.py --quick

# Check output
cat research/battery_journal/journal_2025-10-02.md
```

**Fix any bugs**, refine journal template

---

### **Day 4 (Thursday, Oct 3)** - Enhance Observations
**Time**: 1 hour

**Update journal template** with:
- SOC metrics
- Revenue breakdown
- Strategy comparison
- Research notes specific to battery

---

### **Day 5 (Friday, Oct 4)** - Data Enhancement Research
**Time**: 2 hours

**Research**:
- What ERCOT reports have ancillary service prices?
- What report IDs for MCPCs?
- What report IDs for ASDCs?

**Document** findings for future implementation

---

### **Day 6-7 (Weekend)** - Run First Experiments
**Time**: 2 hours

```bash
# Run battery workflow all week days
# Review accumulated data
# Document initial patterns
# Plan Week 2 experiments
```

---

## 🛠️ Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Battery Workflow Script (Priority 1)

**File**: `scripts/daily_battery_workflow.py`

**Pseudocode**:
```python
def main():
    # 1. Load latest LMP data
    df = load_latest_lmp_data()
    
    # 2. Run battery arbitrage
    battery = BatteryModel(capacity_mw=100, energy_mwh=400)
    results_arbitrage = run_arbitrage_strategy(battery, df)
    
    # 3. Calculate metrics
    pnl = calculate_pnl(results_arbitrage)
    soc_stats = analyze_soc_patterns(results_arbitrage)
    
    # 4. Generate journal
    journal = create_battery_journal(
        date=today,
        pnl=pnl,
        soc_stats=soc_stats,
        market_data=df
    )
    
    # 5. Save results
    save_battery_journal(journal)
    save_battery_results(results_arbitrage)
```

---

### Task 2: Battery Journal Template

**File**: `research/battery_journal/journal_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Battery Research Journal - {date}
## Day {N} of Research Period

### Market Summary
- LMP mean/std
- Price volatility
- High price events

### Battery Performance
- SOC utilization: X%
- Charging cycles: N
- Discharging cycles: M
- Round-trip efficiency: Y%

### Revenue Analysis
- Energy arbitrage: $X
- Total PnL: $Y
- Profit per cycle: $Z

### Strategy Observations
- Optimal charge times: [hours]
- Optimal discharge times: [hours]
- Missed opportunities: N

### Research Notes
- [ ] Key findings
- [ ] Patterns observed
- [ ] Questions raised
```

---

### Task 3: Makefile Update

Add to `Makefile`:
```makefile
battery-daily:
	@echo "🔋 Running daily battery research workflow..."
	@bash -c "source activate_hayeknet.sh && python scripts/daily_battery_workflow.py"
```

---

## 📊 Success Metrics for Week 1

By Sunday Oct 5, you should have:
- [ ] 7 days of battery simulations run
- [ ] 7 battery journal entries
- [ ] Baseline PnL metrics documented
- [ ] SOC pattern observations recorded
- [ ] Initial research findings noted

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Day 1: Validate
make daily
python examples/battery_sced_vs_rtcb.py

# Day 2: Create battery workflow
# (we'll help you build this)

# Day 3+: Run battery workflow
make battery-daily  # (after Makefile update)

# Or directly:
python scripts/daily_battery_workflow.py
```

## 📚 What to Read This Week

1. **Your battery code**:
   - `python/battery_model.py` - Understand the model
   - `python/battery_strategy.py` - Understand strategies
   - `examples/battery_sced_vs_rtcb.py` - See it in action

2. **Research papers**:
   - Pick 2-3 battery storage papers for lit review
   - ERCOT RTC documentation
   - Take notes for your paper

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Keep It Simple
- Start with basic arbitrage only
- Add complexity in Week 2+
- Document everything as you go

### 2. Use Templates
- Copy `daily_research_workflow.py` structure
- Modify for battery-specific needs
- Don't reinvent the wheel

### 3. Focus on Observations
- The data matters most
- Write down what you notice
- Your observations become your paper

### 4. Ask for Help
- If you get stuck, we can assist
- Battery examples already exist
- Lots of working code to learn from

---

## ⚠️ What NOT to Do

1. ❌ Don't try to add AS data yet (complex)
2. ❌ Don't try to implement full RTC+B yet (Week 6-7)
3. ❌ Don't worry about perfect code (iterate)
4. ❌ Don't skip daily runs (data consistency matters)

---

## 🎯 Week 1 Deliverable

**By Oct 5, you'll have**:
- Working battery daily workflow
- 7 days of battery observations
- Baseline understanding of system
- Ready for Week 2 deeper analysis

---

## Next Steps After Week 1

**Week 2-3**: Run more experiments, vary parameters  
**Week 4-5**: Add complexity (AS strategies)  
**Week 6-7**: RTC+B approximation  
**Week 8-9**: RL training & case studies  
**Week 10**: Paper writing
