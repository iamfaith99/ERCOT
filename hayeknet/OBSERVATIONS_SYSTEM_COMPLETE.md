- [ ] Does today support/refute H2?
- [ ] Does today support/refute H3?

### Strategy Insights
- [ ] What worked well?
- [ ] What could improve?
- [ ] Missed opportunities?

### Thesis Connections

## 🔬 Pre-Configured Hypotheses

### H1: Price Volatility → Profitability
**Tracks**: Correlation between market volatility and battery PnL  
**Evidence**: Auto-filled daily with volatility % and PnL  
**Your Job**: Note if pattern holds, build confidence

### H2: Optimal SOC Utilization = 60-80%
**Tracks**: Whether optimal utilization range maximizes cycles  
**Evidence**: Auto-filled with actual utilization %  
**Your Job**: Evaluate if sweet spot exists

### H3: Spread >$15/MWh Required for Profit
**Tracks**: Minimum price spread needed for profitability  
**Evidence**: Auto-calculated spread from charge/discharge  
**Your Job**: Verify threshold, refine if needed

**Add your own** as new hypotheses emerge!

---

## 📊 Example: Day 1 Observation

**Auto-filled**:
- ✅ Market type: Moderate volatility (9.6% CoV)
- ✅ Battery result: UNPROFITABLE ($-3,949.56)
- ✅ SOC utilization: 12.4% (underutilized)
- ✅ Hypothesis H1: Doesn't support (low vol, unprofitable)

**You add**:
```markdown
### Your Analysis
Strategy was too conservative. Only charged (6 intervals),
never discharged. Even with low volatility, there were
discharge opportunities above $80/MWh that were missed.

**Action**: Lower discharge threshold from 70th to 60th percentile.

**Thesis Note**: Section 4.2 - discuss threshold sensitivity.
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Fill Daily (10-15 min)
Don't let observations accumulate! Fresh insights are best.

### 2. Be Honest
- Check "Strategy too conservative" if true
- Note "Missed opportunities" when they happen
- Your observations drive improvements

### 3. Connect to Thesis
Use the thesis prompts daily. These become your paper sections!

### 4. Track Patterns
Look back at previous observations weekly to spot trends.

### 5. Test Hypotheses
Use the evidence to build confidence in your findings.
