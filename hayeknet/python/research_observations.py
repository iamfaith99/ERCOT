## üìä Market Characterization

### Today's Market Type
- [ ] **Low Volatility** (CoV < 10%)
- [{'x' if lmp_cov < 10 else ' '}] **Moderate Volatility** (CoV 10-25%)
- [ ] **High Volatility** (CoV > 25%)
- [ ] **Scarcity Event** (prices > $100/MWh sustained)
- [ ] **Normal Operations** (typical demand pattern)

**Actual**: CoV = {lmp_cov:.1f}%, Mean LMP = ${lmp_mean:.2f}/MWh

### Price Patterns Observed
- [ ] Flat pricing (minimal intraday variation)
- [ ] Clear peak/off-peak structure
- [ ] Multiple price spikes
- [ ] Sustained high prices (>$100/MWh)
- [ ] Negative or near-zero prices
- [ ] Congestion-driven price separation

**Notes**: *Describe what you observed...*

## üîã Battery Performance Analysis

### Profitability Assessment
**Result**: {'‚úÖ PROFITABLE' if battery_profitable else '‚ùå UNPROFITABLE'} (PnL: ${battery_pnl:.2f})

### Why was today profitable/unprofitable?
- [ ] Sufficient price spreads (>$20/MWh spread)
- [ ] Insufficient price spreads (<$10/MWh spread)
- [ ] Good timing (charged at lows, discharged at peaks)
- [ ] Poor timing (charged when prices were rising)
- [ ] Low SOC utilization ({soc_util:.1f}% - underutilized)
- [ ] High SOC utilization ({soc_util:.1f}% - well-utilized)
- [ ] Strategy too conservative
- [ ] Strategy too aggressive

**Your Analysis**: *What was the key factor?*

### SOC Management
- **Utilization**: {soc_util:.1f}%
- **Cycles**: {cycles:.2f}

**Observations**:
- [ ] Battery stayed in middle SOC range (50-60%)
- [ ] Battery cycled fully (used 70-80% capacity)
- [ ] Battery hit SOC limits (10% or 90%)
- [ ] Optimal SOC management observed
- [ ] Suboptimal SOC management observed

**Notes**: *How should SOC be managed for this market type?*

---

## üéØ Strategy Performance

### Simple Arbitrage Strategy
- **Charge threshold**: 30th percentile
- **Discharge threshold**: 70th percentile

**Effectiveness Today**:
- [ ] Excellent - Captured all major opportunities
- [ ] Good - Captured most opportunities
- [ ] Fair - Missed some opportunities
- [ ] Poor - Missed most opportunities

**Missed Opportunities**:
- [ ] Yes - __ intervals where spread was profitable but battery was idle
- [ ] No - Strategy executed as expected

**Notes**: *What could be improved?*

### Comparison: What if we had...
- [ ] Different charge/discharge thresholds?
- [ ] Participated in ancillary services?
- [ ] Had RTC+B co-optimization?
- [ ] Used forecast-based strategy instead of reactive?

**Thoughts**: *Potential improvements...*

---

## üî¨ Research Hypotheses

### Hypothesis Testing

**H1: Higher price volatility ‚Üí Higher arbitrage profitability**
- Market volatility today: {lmp_cov:.1f}%
- Battery PnL: ${battery_pnl:.2f}
- [{'‚úÖ' if lmp_cov > 15 and battery_profitable else '‚ùì'}] Supports hypothesis
- **Notes**: *Update running correlation analysis*

**H2: Optimal SOC utilization is 60-80% for maximizing cycles**
- Utilization today: {soc_util:.1f}%
- Cycles: {cycles:.2f}
- [{'‚úÖ' if 60 <= soc_util <= 80 else '‚ùì'}] Within optimal range
- **Notes**: *Track relationship*

**H3: Peak/off-peak spread must be >$15/MWh for profitability**
- Price spread today: ${battery_metrics.get('discharge_revenue', 0) / max(battery_metrics.get('discharge_intervals', 1), 1) - abs(battery_metrics.get('charge_cost', 0)) / max(battery_metrics.get('charge_intervals', 1), 1):.2f}/MWh
- Profitable: {battery_profitable}
- [{'‚úÖ' if abs(battery_pnl) > 500 and battery_profitable else '‚ùì'}] Supports hypothesis
- **Notes**: *Threshold verification*

### New Hypotheses Generated Today
- [ ] *Add new hypothesis based on today's observations...*

## üìà Patterns & Trends

### Multi-Day Patterns (Update Weekly)
- [ ] Weekday vs weekend differences
- [ ] Time-of-day patterns
- [ ] Weather correlation
- [ ] Seasonal trends (as data accumulates)

**Notes**: *Patterns emerging over past week...*

### Accumulating Evidence For
- [ ] **Finding**: *State an emerging finding...*
  - Evidence: Day {day_num} observation supports this
  - Confidence: Low / Medium / High
  - Days observed: __ / {day_num}

## üí° Insights for Thesis

### Chapter 3 (Methodology)
- [ ] Validated battery model with real data
- [ ] Identified strategy parameter sensitivity
- [ ] Documented market conditions tested

**Notes**: *Method refinements needed...*

### Chapter 4 (Results)
**Key Finding Today**: *One-sentence summary of most important result*

**Quantitative Evidence**:
- PnL: ${battery_pnl:.2f}
- Volatility: {lmp_cov:.1f}%
- Utilization: {soc_util:.1f}%

**Figures Needed**: 
- [ ] SOC trajectory for today
- [ ] Price vs battery actions
- [ ] Cumulative PnL over time

### Chapter 5 (Discussion)
**Implication**: *What does today's result mean for the research question?*

**Connection to Literature**:
- [ ] Relates to [Author, Year]: *How?*
- [ ] Challenges/Supports [Author, Year]: *How?*

---

## üîÑ RTC+B Considerations

### How might RTC+B change today's results?

**Ancillary Service Opportunities**:
- [ ] RegUp prices likely high (volatile market)
- [ ] RegDown prices likely high
- [ ] RRS prices elevated
- [ ] Co-optimization would likely increase revenue by: *estimate $X*

**Strategy Changes Under RTC+B**:
- [ ] Would participate in AS instead of pure arbitrage
- [ ] Would maintain headroom for AS commitments
- [ ] Would bid differently based on ASDCs
- [ ] Would see XX% revenue improvement (estimate)

**Notes**: *RTC+B comparison thoughts...*
